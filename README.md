# WildStocks

Browser-based stockmarket simulation game made with CakePHP and fully connected to Facebook's API. 

It's a virtual market where the player's decisions have a real impact on the stock values.
You can buy and sell stocks, manage your portfolio, follow the price evolution...

All stocks are virtual and not indexed on any real life value.
